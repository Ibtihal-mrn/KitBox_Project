# Kitbox Project

## Overview

**Kitbox** is a desktop application developed in **C#** using the **Avalonia** UI framework. It aims to provide a smooth and modern experience for both customers and sellers when configuring and managing furniture orders.

This project simulates a self-service kiosk system — similar to what you'd find at a fast-food restaurant — but tailored to a customizable furniture business.
