# Kitbox Project

## Overview

**Kitbox** is a desktop application developed in **C#** using the **Avalonia** UI framework. It aims to provide a smooth and modern experience for both customers and sellers when configuring and managing furniture orders.

This project simulates a self-service kiosk system — similar to what you'd find at a fast-food restaurant — but tailored to a customizable furniture business.

## ✨ Features

### 🧍 For Customers:
- Browse and **configure furniture** according to their preferences.
- Place and review orders via a clean, user-friendly interface.
- Pay for their configured furniture, just like using a self-service terminal.

### 🛒 For Sellers:
- **Receive customer orders** and manage them in real time.
- **Manage stock**: view current inventory, update quantities, and handle low-stock alerts.
- **Order new stock** from suppliers directly through the app.
- Access and manage a **calendar/agenda** of upcoming client orders and deliveries.
